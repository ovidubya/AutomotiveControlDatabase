Setup Instructions for Final Project

We use phpmyadamin and MySQL running on a local webserver hosted through WAMPServer.

Step 1: Download and install WAMPServer from http://www.wampserver.com/en/.

Step 2: In your local WAMP directory (default is C:\wamp64) locate the \www\ directory and create a new subdirectory inside it for this group’s project (i.e. C:\wamp64\www\Group10\). These directions will assume you named this subdirectory “Group10”.

Step 3: Copy and paste the provided .php files into this directory. You can also find the source files from our github repository: https://github.com/jctorre8/Database-Management-Final-Project.git 

Step 4: Run wampmanager.exe in the base wamp64 directory. (C:\wamp64\wampmanager.exe).

Step 5: To verify WAMPServer is running properly, open up your web browser and type “localhost” or “http://localhost” into the address bar. This should bring up the WampServer main interface.

Step 6: Type localhost/Group10 or http://localhost/Group10 into the address bar. If you downloaded the files directly from github and can just unzip the files in the C:\wamp64\www\ folder but you’ll have to type http://localhost/Database-Management-Final-Project.

Step 7. Click “create.php”. This will create the database and load all tables so they can be viewed and edited.  

You will see buttons on the left which allow you to access and edit the tables, and buttons on the right of sample SELECT queries we have provided. At the bottom you will see our ER diagram.
